Project during a course in degree Programme in Information and Communication Technology 
Made in collaboration with Love M. 


To run the game a ChipKit uC32 is needed. And a MCB32 compiler is needed to install the game. 

The game is a 2D shooter game resembling a retro space shooter game, but located inside a 
blood vessel where the user acts like a white blood cell shooting and killing bad bacteria 
and other things one dont want inside the blood stream. And need to avoid different obstacles. 

Buttons on the ChipKit is used for movement, displayed in the begining of the game.
